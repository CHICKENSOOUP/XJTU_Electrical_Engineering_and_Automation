Hey, guys. It’s Ron. 
Nice to see you. 
I’m honored to elect the curriculum, 
European cultural origin for this semester. 
It’s such a great course 
that brought me a great command of knowledge
concerning no matter the cultural difference 
between China and the western countries 
or the mysterious mythologies in ancient Greek.
The course started from the Creation Myth, 
explaining the origin of life and all things. 
Then we reached the Olympians, 
worshipping 12 gods with different characters. 
After that, Dc. Qiu brought us a tour for 
the Trojan War featured with Achilles 
and the Trojan horse. 
However, Greek myths are made up of stories 
not only of the goddesses, 
but also demi-gods or heroes, 
who are relatives or descendants of gods. 
From my perspective, 
their stories are 
the most brilliant part of Greek mythologies. 
At last, the stories of Bible lead me to 
the foundation of the whole western culture.
Maybe sometimes, 
remembering the names of different characters 
in Greek mythology 
is just like working on 
a Penelope’s web（ponalepian） 
for me.
Whereas, when I dig deep into
the diverse mythologies, 
I gradually find 
the wonderful stories and outstanding characters
that is worth learning. 
It’s like a golden fleece for me. 
Ultimately, the process of learning 
European cultural origin 
has become an enjoyable travel 
with splendid scenery, 
where I hope that I can leave my footprints.
